## [Predictive Analysis for Housing Prices using CRISP-DM method](predictive-analysis-crisp-dm/predictive-analysis.md)
(<i>Click title to see the complete project</i>)

I just completed a project for Dicoding Indonesiaâ€™s Applied Machine Learning course, focusing on predicting house prices using supervised learning and regression algorithms. The project followed the CRISP-DM method and used the California Housing Prices dataset, with models like Random Forest, AdaBoost, MLP, and SVR. SVR delivered the best performance with the lowest MSE, and median income proved to be the most influential feature. This project sharpened my skills in feature engineering, model tuning with GridSearchCV, and evaluating real-world regression models.
